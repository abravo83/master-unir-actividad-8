## Install Instructions

- PREREQUISITE: Having a MySQL server running locally.
- Run `npm install` as usual to **install all dependencies**.
- Use the `myblog.sql` file content query to **install the DB**.
- **CREATE YOUR OWN .env file**. Use the `.env_example` to **create** your own `.env` file that should contain access to your DB. The .env should have this structure

```

DB_HOST_ADDRESS=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=myblog
PORT=3000

```

but the data within should be your own. Special attention to the DB\_ data. You should know this data already. If not, reinstall MySQL and pay attention and take notes in the installation process.

## To run the project
